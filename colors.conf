# client.focused
# A client which currently has the focus.

# client.focused_inactive
# A client which is the focused one of its container, but it does not have the focus at the moment.

# client.focused_tab_title
# Tab or stack container title that is the parent of the focused container but not directly focused. Defaults to focused_inactive if not specified and does not use the indicator and child_border colors.

# client.unfocused
# A client which is not the focused one of its container.

# client.urgent
# A client which has its urgency hint activated.

# client.placeholder
# Background and text color are used to draw placeholder window contents (when restoring layouts). Border and indicator are ignored.

# client.background
# Background color which will be used to paint the background of the client window on top of which the client will be rendered. Only clients which do not cover the whole area of this window expose the color. Note that this colorclass only takes a single color.

# Colors are in HTML hex format (#rrggbb, optionally #rrggbbaa), see the following example:

# class                 border       bground     text          indicator    child_border
